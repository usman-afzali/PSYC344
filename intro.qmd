This website contains `R` code for statistics labs of the Year 3 [methods and statistics course](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/courseinfo/GetCourseDetails.aspx?course=PSYC344&occurrence=22S2(C)&year=2022). The code is specific to the 2022 Summer course (2022-2023), but is very similar to the previous and *hopefully* future occurrences of the course.

## Labs

#### Lab 1 and 2

These labs are not included here as they don't involve any data analysis. First, let's learn how to use the available code for `lab files`.

#### How to use **Lab Files**

Each of the lab files is a `Quarto Markdwon` or `.qmd` document. One way of using and replicating the code is to use the latest version of `RStudio`, at least `Version: 2022.12.0+353` or later on your computer. Within `RStudio`, click on `new file` drop down menu and open a new `Quarto Document` (see the first figure), and name it. Once the `.qmd` document is opened, go to the `source` tab, erase the default code and paste the code from the corresponding lab file (from line 1 up to the final line). Then hit `Render`. You will see output in the `Viewer` menu. You can click `Show in a new window` to open rendered code in your local browser window (see the second figure for highlighted commands).

#### Lab 3: Descriptive statistics

Use `Lab3-Descriptive-Stats.qmd`.

#### Lab 4: EFA and CFA

Use `Lab4-EFA-and-CFA.qmd`.

## Slides

Slides are made using `revealjs` on `Quarto`. The process of using them is similar as using the other `.qmd` documents explained above. Once they are opened in `RStudio`, the `Present` button from the `Presentation` tab can be used to open the presentation in the local browser - that can be presented from there.

#### Intro to Week 9

Use `Intro-to-Week9.qmd`.
