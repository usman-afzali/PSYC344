## Labs

First, let's learn how to use the available code for `lab files`.

#### Using **Lab Files**

The `R` code in this website is executable. Each of the lab files is a `Quarto Markdwon` or `.qmd` document. 

If you have background in coding and are just looking for a piece of code, or if you want to browse the code, you can access the [Labs](https://usman-afzali.github.io/PSYC344/labs.html) section and click on the relevant lab. The relevant code can be copied and ran on `R scrip`, `R markdown` or `Quarto markdown`.

If you want to access the very `.qmd` documents to use and replicate the code, you should:

1. Use the latest version of `RStudio`, at least `Version: 2022.12.0+353` or later on your computer. 

2. Within `RStudio`, click on `new file` drop down menu and open a new `Quarto Document` (see the first figure), and name it. 

3. Once the `.qmd` document is opened, go to the `source` tab, erase the default code and paste the code from the corresponding lab file (from line 1 up to the final line). Then hit `Render`. You will see output in the `Viewer` menu. 

4. You can click `Show in a new window` to open rendered code in your local browser window (see the second figure for highlighted commands).

::: callout-note
## Repo
`Lab files` are within the `labs` folder in [Github Repo](https://github.com/usman-afzali/PSYC344).
:::

#### Lab 1 and 2

These labs are not included as they don't involve any data analysis. 

#### Lab 3: Descriptive statistics

Use the file `Lab3-Descriptive-Stats.qmd`.

#### Lab 4: EFA and CFA

Use `Lab4-EFA-and-CFA.qmd`.

#### Lab 5: *t*-test

Use `Lab5-t-test.qmd`.

## More to come
Further lab files are yet to be added.

## Slides

Slides are made using `revealjs` on `Quarto`. There are three ways to use them:

1. Use live: From [Presentations](https://usman-afzali.github.io/PSYC344/presentations.html), click the corresponding presentation. They can be displayed live simply by clicking on them and using the keyboard `arrow keys`.

2. Save as pdf: Get to the corresponding presentation as explained above. This option only works with `Google Chrome` as explained [here](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/presenting.html#print-to-pdf).

3. The `revealjs` files: The original code files on [Github Repo](https://github.com/usman-afzali/PSYC344) are inside the `presentations` folder. 

The process of using them is similar as using any other `.qmd` documents explained above. Once they are opened in `RStudio`, the `Present` button from the `Presentation` tab can be used to open the presentation in the local browser - that can be presented from there.

#### Intro to Week 9

Use `Intro-to-Week9.qmd`.

#### Intro to Week 10

Use `Intro-to-Week10.qmd`.

#### Intro to Week 11

Use `Intro-to-Week11.qmd`.

#### Intro to Week 12

Use `Intro-to-Week12.qmd`.

#### Exam guidelines

Use `exam-guidelines.qmd`.
